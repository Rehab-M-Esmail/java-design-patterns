## Title: Identity field pattern in Java
## Short Title: Identity Field

> to allow having a unique key for each instance to ensure consistency by always referring to objects using their unique identifiers.
## Detailed Explanation of Identity field Pattern with Real-World Examples
## Category : Creational
## lang : en
Real-world Example

> A real-world example of the Identity filed pattern is  Library Management System. A library tracks books borrowed by users. Each book needs a unique identity to distinguish it, even if multiple copies of the same title exist. to solve this
Use the Identity Field pattern to assign each book a unique id (e.g., ISBN or database-generated ID).
Persist book details in a database with id as the primary key.
In plain words

Wikipedia says

> A primary key is a designated attribute (column) that can reliably identify and distinguish between each individual record in a table.

## Programmatic Example of Identity Field Pattern in Java


Key Components:

1. `DomainObject`: This class uses properties to generate IDs using incremental method were every instance get the incremented value of the previous one.

```java
package com.iluwater.fieild;


import jakarta.persistence.Id;
import jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import jakarta.persistence.GenerationType;

@MappedSuperclass
public abstract class DomainObject {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) // automatically generate unique values for primary key columns
    //strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY generate the primary key value by the database itself using the auto-increment column option
    private Long id;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
}

```

## When to Use the Identity field Pattern in Java

Use the Identity field Pattern in Java when:

* ORMs like Hibernate and JPA rely heavily on the Identity Field Pattern to map objects to rows in a database.
*  Microservices with Distributed Systems
* Content Management Systems (CMS)
*  Financial Systems
*  Healthcare Management Systems

## Real-World Applications of Identity Field pattern in Java

* Amazon's inventory system uses unique productId values for inventory tracking across multiple warehouses globally.
* An airline assigns unique ticketId values to each booking, which are linked to passenger details and flight schedules.
* A hospital management system assigns a unique patientId to each patient to link their medical records securely.

## Benefits and Trade-offs of Identity Field pattern

Benefits:

* This pattern is essential when the uniqueness of certain attributes is required to maintain data integrity, avoid conflicts, and support efficient lookups.

Trade-offs:

* Storage Overhead.
* Complications with Composite IDs
* Overhead of ID Generation if not incremental or includes characters
